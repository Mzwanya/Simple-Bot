# Python Bot - Xpo

This is a simple interactive Python bot named **Xpo**, created in **May 2024** by Dennis Kaunda. The bot can greet users, guess their age, test their programming knowledge, and perform counting tasks. It also includes features like personalized greetings based on the time of day, error handling, and randomized test questions.

## Features

- **Personalized Greeting**: The bot greets users based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).
- **Name Remembrance**: Users can choose whether the bot remembers their name during the session.
- **Age Guessing**: Xpo uses math tricks to guess the user's age based on their input.
- **Counting Ability**: The bot can count up to any number specified by the user.
- **Programming Knowledge Test**: A mini-quiz with randomized questions to test basic programming knowledge.
- **User-friendly Interaction**: Simple menu-based system that lets users choose actions.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs gracefully during interaction.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script to your local machine.
2. Run the `python` script using a terminal or your favorite IDE.

### Example:

```
python SimpleBot.py
```

3. Follow the prompts to interact with the bot.

## Code Structure

- **greet(bot_name, birth_year, creator_name)**: The bot introduces itself with a personalized greeting.
- **remind_name()**: Asks the user for their name and optionally remembers it.
- **guess_age()**: The bot guesses the user's age based on mathematical remainders.
- **count()**: The bot counts up to a number specified by the user.
- **test()**: A simple quiz to test the user's programming knowledge.
- **end()**: A closing message from the bot.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements

- Adding more interactive features like conversations on different topics.
- Expanding the quiz with more questions.
- Introducing a simple help system for users unfamiliar with the bot commands.
